        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">The North West CDC is constantly exploring ways to connect our partners to the needs in the community. An expansion from the <strong>WeCare @ North West Service Weeks</strong> programme's usual food distribution at the start of the year, the CDC distributed health and hygiene products to 7,000 needy residents for the first time.</p>   

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">Each care pack worth around $200 consists of eight items: handwash, sanitizer, wet wipes, as well as five different types of vitamins. As the nation transits into a Covid-19 resilient community, the health and hygiene care pack distribution aims to promote good health and hygiene habits. All items in the care packs were fully sponsored by the CDC's two corporate partners, Guardian Health &amp; Beauty and Thunderquote. </p> 

        <p style="text-align: center; padding: 15px 0px;"> 

          <img src="images/bagpack.gif" style="width: 100%; max-width: 750px; margin: 10px auto;" /> 

        </p> 

        <p style="font-family: Arial, serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; text-align: justify;">To manage the scale of preparing 7,000 care packs, North West CDC rallied various corporate and community volunteers to step forward and support the cause. The care packs were first packed at two schools, Wellington Primary and Woodlands Secondary Schools, and then distributed by the local North West Divisions to their residents in June, through house visits and distribution drives.</p>

I hope to be able to work the CDC on more programmes which enrich our students' learning outside of the classroom."</em></p>
